/**
 * Use this class as a static extension. Then, without any further setup, you
 * can begin calling these functions as if they were instance methods. Sample:
 * 
 * object0.simpleWidth(30);
 * object0.simpleHeight(40);
 * object0.alignBottomRight();
 * 
 * object1.simpleScale();
 * object1.center();
 * 
 * object2.fillWidth();
 * object2.simpleHeight();
 * object2.below(object1);
 * 
 * Remember: set width and height before setting an object's position. Your
 * instructions will be run in order, and position often depends on dimensions.
